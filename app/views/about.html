<hr />
<p>The Meta Idea app was created as a competitor in ICC's Hack-A-Thon 2015. In a competition where developers were asked to code an app that would benefit ICC, we thought of our app as the first step to those solutions! We would create a space where people from all departments could post problems for which they would like an app. Then, developers could create apps based off the most common problems.</p>
